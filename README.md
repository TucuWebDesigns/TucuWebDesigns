# About meðŸ‘‹

Hello! I am MatÃ­as Herrera, I am a passionate and enthusiastic Front End Developer with many desires to immerse myself in the working world of programming and contribute significantly in the area. Although I currently have no formal work experience, I am full of energy, determination, and a genuine desire to learn and grow professionally.
In 2002, I began my studies at the National Technological University of Argentina to try to obtain the title of Informatic Engineer. Two years later I decided to change to the Universidad del Norte Santo TomÃ¡s de Aquino where I continued my studies for four more years, obtaining the intermediate title of Computer Analyst in the fourth year of the degree, then in the last year of the course, for personal reasons,I had to quit my career and I can not finished it.
During this time, I have acquired valuable skills in areas such as research, data analysis, determination, creativity, curiosity, teamwork and a keen interest in programming. I am a very self-taught person, from a very early age I acquired the skill of continuous study and learning, I firmly believe in the importance of it.
My main focus right now is to find an opportunity where I can apply and expand my knowledge while contributing to the success of a team or project. 
Outside of my informatic studies, I am passionate about sports, where I also had the opportunity and decided to study and obtain the title of a profession related to what I am passionate about, such as being a Physical Education Teacher, where I discovered another of my passions, which is teaching. 
I am excited about the opportunities the future has in store and am willing to work hard to achieve my professional goals. If you are looking for someone with enthusiasm, commitment, and a strong desire to learn, I would love to connect with you!.
Feel free to message me if you have any questions or would like to know more about my experience and skills.
